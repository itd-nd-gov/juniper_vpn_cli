h1. Linux Command-line setup for Juniper SSL VPN


h2. Setup

There are a few Ruby gems that will need to be installed to make the Rake tasks work:

<pre>
gem install rake
gem install httpclient
gem install selenium-webdriver
gem install highline
</pre>


h2. Config File

Some configuration needs to be loaded in order for the Rake tasks to work.
You need to create a config.yml file in the same directory as your Rakefile.
You can also run the Rake task 'makeconfig' if you want to be prompted for
the answers and have the config file created for you.


Here is an example config.yml file:
<pre>
--- 
:ivehost: mypvnhost.example.org
:title_page1: MySite VPN Portal
:title_page2: Secure Access SSL VPN - Home
</pre>
